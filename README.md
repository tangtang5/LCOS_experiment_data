There are experimental data
Five 18650 type Degraded LiBs were used in the experiment, which remained 80% around capacity of original batteries. The purpose of the experiments was to get the efficiencies of the Degraded LiBs. The capacity and charge-discharge efficiency of batteries were tested by an Arbin battery test system.

Experiment 1. Capacity and charge-discharge efficiency test
Testing	Steps
Full charging	Charging batteries by two-stage method
The first pause	Keeping the battery in a non-charge-discharge state for one hour
Discharging state	Discharge of batteries at r = {0.2 c, 0.5 c, 1 c} multiples stops when the voltage reaches the lower limit of 2.75 V.
The second pause	Keeping the battery in a non-charge-discharge state for one hour
Setting up loops and ending tests	Repeating the above steps and finishing the test after three cycles.
Total time	480 hours



Experiment 2. Measurement of self-discharge capacity and rate of experimental Degraded LiBs
n these experiments, the batteries No. 1, No. 2 and No. 5 were charged with the two-stage method, then they were laid idle at room temperature for one month. Then the self-discharge rate of the batteries was tested. The capacity and self-discharge rate of batteries No. 1, No. 2 and No. 5 are shown in Table 5. The first estimation was tested in 2019/7/15, and the second estimation was tested in 2019/8/26-29.
